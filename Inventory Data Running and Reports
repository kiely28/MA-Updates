üß≠ System Diagram Explanation: Stocktaking Inventory Result and Reporting Automation

1. Overview

The system automates the end-to-end process of stocktaking result extraction, calculation, and reporting through an integrated Excel VBA Macro and SAP GUI scripting workflow. It consists of four main components:

A. Stocktaking Inventory Result Extraction

B. Stocktaking Summary Report

C. Stocktaking Result per Section Incharge

D. Difference Posting Check


All modules interact with SAP GUI, Excel Macros, and predefined Excel templates to produce accurate and consistent reports stored in a shared directory.


---

2. System Components and Interaction Flow

A. Stocktaking Inventory Result

1. User Action:
The user opens the Excel macro file (Inventory Data Results and Report Macro.xlsm) and triggers the Stocktaking Inventory Results process.


2. System Validation:
The macro checks that SAP GUI is installed, scripting is enabled, and login credentials are available.


3. SAP Automation:
The macro logs into SAP automatically, navigates to the target transaction code (e.g., ZAML3E), and sets selection criteria such as Plant Codes (R101, R102, R10A, R10E) and date ranges.


4. Data Extraction and Processing:
SAP exports the raw data to Excel. The macro cleans up unnecessary columns, formats numeric values (e.g., Price USD), and performs calculations for totals and percentage variances.


5. File Generation:
The system assigns a custom file name (e.g., R101_Oct2025_Result.xlsx), ensures the folder D:\Inventory Data Results and Reports exists, and saves the result file.


6. Output:
A formatted Excel file containing stocktaking results per plant, ready for analysis and reporting.




---

B. Stocktaking Summary Report

1. Input:
The exported Excel file from Step A is used as the data source.


2. Data Transformation:
A new worksheet ("Pivot Result") is created, and a Pivot Table summarizes data by Plant (e.g., Sys Avail. Quantity (A)).


3. Template Integration:
The summarized data is copied into the predefined template (PR Stock Discrepancy Summary July 2025.xlsx).


4. Formula Verification & Output:
The template formulas (e.g., Overall Totals) are verified, and the file is saved as an updated summary report.




---

C. Stocktaking Result Per Section Incharge

1. Input:
Source file from Step A (Stocktaking Inventory Results).


2. Data Processing:
The macro creates another Pivot Table, this time grouped by Section Incharge instead of Plant.


3. Template Integration:
The Pivot Table results are pasted into the designated template (Stocktaking Result Per Section Incharge Template.xlsx).


4. Output:
The report shows summarized results per Section Incharge, ensuring accountability and visibility of discrepancies per responsible section.




---

D. Difference Posting Check

1. Trigger:
The user runs the Discrepancy Posting Check macro from the same Excel workbook.


2. Data Consolidation:
Values (e.g., Sum of Actual Available Quantity per Plant) are copied from the Stocktaking Summary Report and pasted into another template (PR Difference Posting Check.xlsx).


3. SAP Validation:
The macro logs into SAP again and navigates to a transaction (e.g., ZAML2M, ME2N, or MB52) to re-extract availability or movement data.


4. Comparison and Analysis:
The exported SAP data is summarized into a Pivot Table for comparison against Excel-calculated results.


5. Template Update and Saving:
The checked and verified difference report is saved under D:\Inventory Data Results and Reports with a plant/date-based file name.


6. End Process:
SAP session is automatically closed after completion.

Here‚Äôs a sample System Diagram (bullet-type explanation) for your Stocktaking Inventory Result and Reporting Automation project ‚Äî written in a structured, easy-to-understand format suitable for documentation or presentation.

üß≠ System Diagram Explanation (Bullet Type)

Title: Stocktaking Inventory Result and Reporting Automation System Diagram


---

1. User Interaction Layer

Users initiate the process through the Excel Macro Workbook (Inventory Data Results and Report Macro.xlsm).

The macro acts as the main control hub for all automated processes.

Users only need to click specific buttons (e.g., ‚ÄúRun Stocktaking Results‚Äù or ‚ÄúRun Difference Check‚Äù).

System validates SAP GUI installation, login credentials, and folder paths before running automation.



---

2. Excel Macro Layer (Automation Engine)

Handles the automation logic using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications).

Executes multiple modules for:

Stocktaking Inventory Result extraction from SAP.

Stocktaking Summary Report creation.

Section Incharge Report preparation.

Difference Posting Check comparison.


Automates data cleaning, formatting, calculation, and pivot generation steps.

Generates custom file names based on Plant and Date (e.g., R101_Oct2025_Result.xlsx).



---

3. SAP GUI Layer (Data Source System)

The Excel macro communicates with SAP GUI Scripting.

SAP processes are triggered automatically (e.g., ZAML3E, ME2N, MB52).

SAP exports real-time inventory and stock data back to Excel.

Plants and selection criteria (e.g., R101, R102, R10A, R10E) are set programmatically by the macro.

After export, SAP session closes automatically to ensure security.



---

4. Data Processing and Computation Layer

The exported SAP data is transformed in Excel.

Macro performs:

Deletion of unnecessary columns (e.g., Profit Center).

Formatting of numeric and currency columns.

Calculation of totals and percentage discrepancies.


Data is summarized via Pivot Tables for:

Per Plant Analysis (Stocktaking Summary Report).

Per Section In-Charge Analysis (Section Incharge Report).




---

5. Template Integration Layer

Processed data is automatically copied into predefined Excel Templates, such as:

PR Stock Discrepancy Summary July 2025.xlsx

Stocktaking Result Per Section Incharge Template.xlsx

PR Difference Posting Check.xlsx


The macro checks that all formulas (e.g., totals, percentage variance) calculate correctly.

Ensures report uniformity across departments.



---

6. Output and Storage Layer

All final reports are saved automatically in the folder:

D:\Inventory Data Results and Reports


Folder structure example:

/Results ‚Äì Stocktaking outputs per plant

/Summary ‚Äì Consolidated summary reports

/SectionIncharge ‚Äì Reports by section

/DifferenceCheck ‚Äì Posting validation files


Each file includes timestamps and plant codes for tracking.

7. System Flow Summary (End-to-End Flow)

1. User runs macro from Excel.


2. Excel VBA logs into SAP automatically.


3. SAP GUI extracts stock data per plant.


4. Excel VBA processes and formats the exported data.


5. Excel VBA creates pivot tables and inserts results into templates.


6. Reports are generated, named, and saved to the designated folder.


7. SAP session closes automatically after successful execution.
