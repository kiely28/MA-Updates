Here’s a clear and concise Before and After Scenario Explanation you can use for your documentation or presentation:


---

Before: Using Excel VBA Macro

The attendance tapping process was done using an Excel VBA Macro.
Employees had to manually tap their ID numbers into the Excel file, which then triggered the macro to retrieve and populate their details (e.g., name, department, position) and record the time-in.
However, this approach required users to wait several seconds for the data to populate, and the file had to remain open on a single workstation. This setup limited accessibility, caused delays during large meetings, and increased the risk of file corruption or accidental data loss.

After: Web Attendance Tapping System

The process is now improved through a web-based attendance tapping system.
Employees can simply tap or enter their ID via a browser interface, and the system instantly validates the user and records their attendance in a central database.
Details are displayed in real-time, and meeting in-charges can view, monitor, and generate reports through the web dashboard. This eliminates file dependency, improves response time, and supports multiple concurrent users, making the attendance logging process more efficient and reliable.

Would you like me to make this version more formal and report-style (for proposal or documentation) or simplified and visual (for presentation or infographic)?

Here’s a polished and complete Before and After Scenario Explanation tailored to your description:

Before: Using Excel VBA Macro

The attendance tapping process was previously handled through an Excel VBA Macro.
During meetings, employees had to manually tap or input their ID numbers in the Excel file, which then triggered the macro to retrieve their information and record their time-in.
This method required each user to wait for the details to populate, often causing delays—especially during large gatherings like SV Meetings, Leaders’ Meetings, or Local Managers’ Meetings.
Additionally, the Excel-based setup was limited to one device, prone to lag or data errors, and dependent on continuous file availability and proper macro function.

After: Web Attendance Tapping System

The process has been enhanced through a Web-Based Attendance Tapping System designed for faster and more reliable meeting attendance logging.
Employees can now tap their ID or scan directly through a web interface, which instantly validates the employee record and logs attendance in a centralized database.
This system is primarily used for SV Meetings, Leaders’ Meetings, and Local Managers’ Meetings, but it is also flexible for other meetings and training sessions that require attendance tracking.
It enables real-time monitoring, multiple device access, and accurate reporting, ensuring a seamless and efficient attendance recording experience.
