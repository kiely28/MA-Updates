Great 👍 Here’s your System Diagram with Data Flow in tree-style bullets — this shows not just the components, but also how data moves between them step by step.

🔹 Centralized Automation App – System + Data Flow Diagram

User

Opens Central App UI

Selects:

KP26 scenario → uses Cost Center Excel

SALR scenario → uploads Coefficient Excel





---

Central App UI

Triggers WinActor automation based on button selection

Passes input parameters → file paths, Run ID, scenario type




---

WinActor Automation

SAP Interaction

Opens SAP → login via macro

Executes Tcodes (KP26, KP27, SALR)

Receives system responses/messages → used for logging


Excel Interaction

Reads input files:

Cost Center list (for KP26)

Coefficient file (for SALR)


Writes outputs:

Prooflist Excel (with status + screenshots reference)



Macro Execution

Calculates fiscal quarter (+1 month) → provides input values for SAP

Validates coefficient file → ensures correct quarter & values

Compiles Outlook recipients → provides TO/CC list


Screenshot Capture

Each save/update → stored in Proof folder

Paths recorded in Prooflist Excel





---

SAP System

Receives input from WinActor:

KP26 → cost center values (quarterly)

KP27 → verification request

SALR → add/update/delete % O/H rates


Returns output:

Success/failure messages → captured by WinActor

Screen display → captured as screenshots





---

Excel Files (Data Flow)

Input Data:

Cost Center list → flows into WinActor → into SAP (KP26)

Coefficient file → flows into WinActor → into SAP (SALR)

Recipient list → flows into Outlook for email notification


Output Data:

Prooflist Excel ← created by WinActor ← data from SAP updates + screenshots

Used later as email attachment





---

Outlook (Email Notification)

Input:

Recipient list (from Excel)

Email body (from .txt file)

Prooflist Excel (from WinActor output)


Output:

Sent email → recipients notified with attachment





---

Logging & Archive (Audit Trail)

Input: Run ID + system execution data (time, user, errors, proof files)

Output:

Run folder with logs, Prooflist, screenshots

Archived by timestamp for auditing





---

✅ With this view, you can trace data flow like a pipeline:
Excel Input → WinActor → SAP → Prooflist (Excel + Screenshots) → Outlook → Recipients


---

Do you want me to condense this into a single linear flow (like a pipeline bullet chain) so it reads as:
User → App UI → WinActor → SAP → Excel Prooflist → Outlook → Notification → Archive?
