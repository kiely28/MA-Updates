Your proposal is already clear and well-structured üëç I‚Äôve polished the grammar, flow, and formatting slightly to make it more professional and easy to read:

Background
Currently, the GNS+ Application Form retrieves employee details directly from tbl_employee. When section in-charges from other departments submit requests, mismatches in the GNS+ user ID are often overlooked due to auto-populated fields. This leads to incorrect entries, particularly for employees who still use the ‚ÄúPH‚Äù format (no APO account yet) but have recently created their APO accounts.

Conclusion and Judgment
To ensure data consistency and prevent incorrect GNS+ user IDs, the system should validate information against tbl_auth before retrieving details from tbl_employee.

Target Setting
Ensure 100% accuracy of GNS+ user ID retrieval by validating data against tbl_auth before tbl_employee.

Proposal Details
This proposal aims to improve the accuracy of employee information in the GNS+ Application Form by updating its data validation process. Currently, the system retrieves records directly from tbl_employee, which often results in mismatched or incorrect GNS+ user IDs, especially for employees using the ‚ÄúPH‚Äù format.

The proposed change is to first check and validate employee information in tbl_auth before pulling details from tbl_employee. This adjustment will prevent overwriting valid GNS+ user IDs and ensure that updated accounts are reflected correctly.

Expectation of Activity

Improve accuracy of GNS+ user IDs.

Minimize errors caused by auto-populated fields.

Ensure consistency of records with official data in tbl_auth.

Provide smoother request handling for departments.

‚ú® This version keeps it simple but formal enough for a proposal.

Would you like me to also add a Final Message/Recommendation at the end, so it feels more complete and persuasive?
